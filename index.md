## Juliana Dias

Hello! I'm **Juliana Dias** — a Senior Ruby Software Engineer, Technical Reviewer at **Packt**, and long-time community leader at **Ruby Brasil**.
For more than 12 years, I’ve been building software, mentoring developers, and helping the Ruby community grow across Brazil.

### About Me
Ruby has been my craft and my community for over 12 years.
As a Software Engineer and Technical Reviewer – Ruby Specialist at Packt, I focus on writing, reviewing, and refining content that’s technically accurate, clear, and genuinely useful to developers.

Beyond the code, I’ve dedicated my career to building and leading the Ruby Brasil communities — organizing events like **Tropical on Rails**, **Ruby Summit Brasil**, and speaking as a keynote at **RubyConf+ Brasil 2022**.

Whether I’m reviewing a book, hosting a meetup, or connecting developers across Brazil, my mission is the same: **help people grow, share knowledge, and make technology better together.**

### What I Do

- 💎 **Ruby Engineering & Leadership** — Designing, developing, and maintaining Ruby on Rails systems for high-impact products and teams.
- ✍️ **Technical Writing & Reviewing** — Helping shape developer resources that are clear, correct, and useful.
- 🌱 **Community & Open Source** — Organizer at **Ruby Brasil**, contributor to **Tropical.rb**, and advocate for open, collaborative learning.
- 🤝 **Mentorship & Speaking** — Guiding developers, hosting meetups, and speaking at events like **RubyConf+ Brasil 2022**.
- 🔐 **DevSecOps Culture** — Integrating security and operational excellence across the software lifecycle.
